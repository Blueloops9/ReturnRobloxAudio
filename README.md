# ReturnRobloxAudio
Just something that I came up with in a couple of hours

(NOTE): This could potentially download malware onto your device if the webserver is unsafe, so please use with caution.
^ we use anti virus software to scan every file that gets uploaded, we also use hash verification so this is highly unlikly

How to upload a file
1. go to https://audio.deathcubed.com/
2. insert email, and click SUBMIT
3. check email for code, and insert code into the slot, and insert a mp3 file (Mp3 IS THE ONLY THING SUPPORTED)
4. click submit!
5. Copy and paste id from server response (without the [])
6. To play in roblox you must format it like this: rbxasset://sounds/ReturnRobloxAudio/\[id_here\]
